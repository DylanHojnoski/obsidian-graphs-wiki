# CurveUnion

Union of two closed path elements. Takes two elements for parameters. You will also want to put a `fillColor` in the `att` which takes a string of a hex code or color name.

````yaml
```graph
bounds: [-10, 10, 10, -10]
keepAspectRatio: true
elements: [
	{type: functiongraph, def: ["f:cos(x)"]},
	{type: inequality, def: ["e0"], att: {inverse:true, fillOpacity: 0.1}},
	{type: circle, def: [[0,0], 4]},
	{type: curveunion, def: ["e1", "e2"], att: {fillColor: yellow, fillOpacity: 0.6}}
]
```
