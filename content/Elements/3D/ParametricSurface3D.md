# ParametricSurface3D

ParametricSurface3D creates a parametric surface on the 3D board which takes three function for the x, y, and z axes and then two arrays of length two the first being the range of u and the second being the range of v.  For example `["f:". "f:". "f:", [min, max], [min, max]]` in the functions use __x__ as u and __y__ as v.
