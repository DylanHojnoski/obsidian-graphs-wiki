# Vectorfield3D

Vectorfield3D creates a vectorfield on the 3D board it takes an array of three functions for the x, y, and z axes and then takes three arrays of length three which describe the start value, number of steps, and the end value of the x, y, and z axes. For example `[[f:x, f:y, f:z], [xStart, xSteps, xEnd], [yStart, ySteps, yEnd], [zStart, zSteps, zEnd]]`.
