# Curve3D

Curve3D creates a curve on the 3D board it takes three functions for x, y, and z coordinate and then the an array for the range of the curve. for example `["f:", "f:", "f:". [num, num]]` for variables in the functions only use __x__ even thought in the second it will be for __y__ and the third function it will be for __z__.
